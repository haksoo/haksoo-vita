haksoo-vita
------------

-- README from original repo:
A simple `.tex` template for making a nicely-formatted academic curriculum vitae. I use this as a template for [my own vita](http://kieranhealy.org/vita.pdf) and put it up here because people regularly emailed me asking for the `.tex` source.

-- My comment:
I think haksoo-vita.tex could be a good example for more academic but still industrial background.
